# gitbook-plugin-python 

## What is it ? 
A Gitbook plugin for including Python file content in a code block in your book 

## How to install it 
In your `book.json` configuration file add 

```json
{
    "plugins": ["python"]
}
```

## How to use it 

In your markdown file simply add 

```
!PYTHON src=./path/to/python/file exec=true|false
```

This tag will be replaced with a block of code and a download link for the python file will be automatically generated.
Also if the exec option is set then the python code is executed and the standard output is reported to the gitbook.

The python executable and the timeout (seconds) for execution control can be specify in your book.json configuration file 

```
"pluginsConfig": {
        "python":{
            "executable": "python",
            "timeout": 120.0
        }
}
```
